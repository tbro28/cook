      <description>Bought these during one of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Cyber Monday deals. They work good for me and can be used in an Instant Pot too. However, I stopped using the Instant Pot with them, because it is hard to dial in the doneness and it is way overkill to use a pressure cooking poached eggs anyways. Now, with the whole egg still in the shell pressure cookers are great for soft and hard boiled eggs.</description>

      <description>Ingredients Head of green cabbage.
1 cup of water.
Instructions Cut the cabbage into eighths.
Cook it for 7 minutes on high with a quick release.
Notes Came out tender, but not mushy. For me anything over 7 minutes starts to get too mushy for my tastes. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen other recipes that say 10 minutes, but&amp;hellip;you can always cook it longer if desired if 7 isn&amp;rsquo;t enough.</description>

      <description>Ingredients Frozen ground beef
1 cup of water
Instructions 25 minutes on high with a quick release.
Notes Also added onions, garlic, and taco seasoning at the beginning. Bad mistake!
Add the onions, garlic, and seasoning after the initial pressure cooking (or they turn to liquid and burn to the bottom; see pic 2!).
Want to alter this to 1&amp;frasl;2 cup of water, because the ground beef released a lot of liquid that took a while to cook down.</description>

In some of my sous vide pictures you can see that I also use it to weigh down food that wants to float to the top.</description>

Then grill them in a cast iron skillet with butter to add a sear to them.
Seared in a cast iron skillet with oil and butter.
