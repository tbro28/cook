      <description>Broccoli, Cauliflower, Carrots for Zero Minutes Came out tender, but not mushy.
1 cup of water and set it to zero minutes.
Zero minutes does sound a little low, but it works :)
Quick released 1 minute after the alarm sounds to let me know that zero minutes was reached.

      <description> Frozen burgers at 147 for 60 minutes Did the 147 degree for 60 minutes recipe.
The patties were frozen and over an inch thick, so I left it in for an hour.
Then grilled them on cast iron with butter to add a sear to them.
Very good final result.

Definitely one of the first major wins in my early sous vide journey.

      <description> Eggs at 167 for 13 minutes Did the 167 degree for 13 minutes recipe.
The egg came out still having white as runny on the outside, which made it easy to break and get out.

      <description>Frozen Chicken 1 cup of water and set it to 10 minutes.
Also added a packet of Trade Joes chicken stock.
I was supposed to do a natural release, but I did a quick release and it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to affect the texture.
It came out tender, but I still plan to play with the times a bit in the future. Primarily because recommendations online that I read were all over the place.</description>

      <description>Frozen Ground Beef Came out tender.
1 cup of water and set it to 25 minutes with a quick release.
Also added onions, garlic, and taco seasoning.
Would alter this to 1&amp;frasl;2 cup of water, plus add the onions, garlic, and seasoning after the initial pressure cooking.</description>

      <description>Garlic Cauliflower Mash Bag of cauliflower florets from Costco.
2.5 TBSPs of butter.
6 cloves of garlic (I&amp;rsquo;d use 4 next time at the max).
Salt, Pepper, and Paprika.
1/4th cup 2% milk (would be richer with half and half or whole milk).
Cooked the cauliflower on high for 5 minutes with a quick release.
During that I sautéed the garlic.
Then after the cauliflower is done, dump it all into a blender and blend.</description>

      <description>Cooking pork chops and finished in bacon grease in cast iron Used the Joule to cook fresh bone-on pork chops at at 140 degrees for 1 hour.
While that was cooking I cooked 8 strips of bacon in a cast iron skillet.
After the pork chops were done I browned the pork chops in the left over bacon grease. Why not?</description>

      <description>Ribs 3-2-1 Method Came out tender, but not fall off the bone.
Basically, followed various sites and books; there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot to the basic process.
Removed the membrane and used a rib rub.
Place ribs in smoker at 225 degrees F for three hours.
Wrap ribs tightly in foil and smoke for 2 hours.
Take foil off and return to smoker bone side down for 1 hour.
Apply sauce to ribs during the last 30 minutes of cooking time.</description>

      <description>Sous Vide Frozen Cod Used the Joule to cook frozen cod fillets roughly 1.5 inched thick at 122 degrees for 1.5 hours.
I actually want to try it at 131 degrees next time to make it even more flaky.
I may just be used to over cooked fish though :)</description>

These both are made by Lodge and heavy.
I seasoned them three times at 400 degrees for an hour each time.

      <description>Ping Pong Balls To Retain Heat Went to the Dollar Tree near my house and bought 8 packages of 6 balls.
These trap the water from evaporating on long cooks.
It has so far been extremely effective.

      <description>Chainmail Scrubbers This thing works great on quickly cleaning stainless steel and cast iron.
When cooking via sous vide, I also throw this on top of bags of food that want to float to keep them down.
So far it has worked really well.</description>

      <description>Morton&amp;rsquo;s Tri-tip at 130 for 6 hours Came out extremely tender.
7 hours might make it a little better in the middle.
Cutting a 3.5 - 4 lb tri-tip in half also could help.
Seared in a cast iron skillet with oil and butter.
15 seconds per flip for two minutes.
