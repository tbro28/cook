      <description>Ingredients Package of corned beef (with the seasoning packet)
4 cups of water
Onion
Potatoes
Carrots
Cabbage
Instructions  Rinse the meat to get rid of as much salt as possible Cut the meat into 4 pieces (easier to fit into my Instant Pot and it cooks faster).
 Place it in the pot trying to make one level layer.
 Pour in the water and sprinkle the seasoning packet on the meat.</description>

      <title>Frozen Ground Beef</title>

      <description>Ingredients Frozen ground beef
1 cup of water
Instructions 25 minutes on high with a quick release.
Notes Frozon turkey also works great at 25 minutes.
The first time I also added onions, garlic, and taco seasoning at the beginning. Bad mistake!
Add the onions, garlic, and seasoning after the initial pressure cooking (or they turn to liquid and burn to the bottom; see pic 2!).
Want to alter this to 1&amp;frasl;2 cup of water, because the ground beef released a lot of liquid that took a while to cook down.</description>

      <description>Tri-tip at 130 for 6 hours Ingredients Tri-tip.
Instructions Cook it at 130 degree for 6 hours.
Then grill them in a cast iron skillet with butter to add a sear to them.
Seared in a cast iron skillet with oil and butter.
15 seconds per flip for two minutes.
Notes Came out extremely tender.
7 hours might make it a little better in the middle.
Cutting a 3.5 - 4 lb tri-tip in half also could help.</description>
