      <description>Tri-tip at 130 for 6 hours Ingredients Tri-tip.
Instructions Cook it at 130 degree for 6 hours.
Then grill them in a cast iron skillet with butter to add a sear to them.
Seared in a cast iron skillet with oil and butter.
15 seconds per flip for two minutes.
Notes Came out extremely tender.
7 hours might make it a little better in the middle.
Cutting a 3.5 - 4 lb tri-tip in half also could help.</description>
