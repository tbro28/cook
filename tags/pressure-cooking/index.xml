      <description>Broccoli, Cauliflower, Carrots for Zero Minutes Came out tender, but not mushy.
1 cup of water and set it to zero minutes.
Zero minutes does sound a little low, but it works :)
Quick release immediately after the alarm sounds to let me know that zero minutes was reached.
Waiting even one minute makes the vegtables soft.

      <description>Frozen Chicken 1 cup of water and set it to 10 minutes.
Also added a packet of Trade Joes chicken stock.
I was supposed to do a natural release, but I did a quick release and it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to affect the texture.
It came out tender, but I still plan to play with the times a bit in the future. Primarily because recommendations online that I read were all over the place.</description>

      <title>Frozen Ground Beef</title>

      <guid>https://tbro28.github.io/cook/blog/2015/10/10/pressure_frozen_ground_beef/</guid>
      <description>Ingredients Frozen ground beef
1 cup of water
Instructions 25 minutes on high with a quick release.
Notes Also added onions, garlic, and taco seasoning. Add the onions, garlic, and seasoning after the initial pressure cooking (or they turn to liquid and burn to the bottom; see pic 2!).
Want to alter this to 1&amp;frasl;2 cup of water, because the ground beef released a lot of liquid that took a while to cook down.</description>
