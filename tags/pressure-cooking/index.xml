      <description>Broccoli, Cauliflower, Carrots for Zero Minutes Came out tender, but not mushy.
1 cup of water and set it to zero minutes.
Zero minutes does sound a little low, but it works :)
Quick released 1 minute after the alarm sounds to let me know that zero minutes was reached.

      <description>Frozen Chicken Came out tender.
1 cup of water and set it to 10 minutes.
Also added a packet of Trade Joes chicken stock.
I was supposed to do a natural release, but I did a quick release and it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to affect the texture.</description>

      <description>Frozen Ground Beef Came out tender.
1 cup of water and set it to 25 minutes with a quick release.
Also added onions, garlic, and taco seasoning.
Would alter this to 1&amp;frasl;2 cup of water, plus add the onions, garlic, and seasoning after the initial pressure cooking.</description>

      <description>Garlic Cauliflower Mash Bag of cauliflower florets from Costco.
2.5 TBSPs of butter.
6 cloves of garlic (I&amp;rsquo;d use 4 next time at the max).
Salt, Pepper, and Paprika.
1/4th cup 2% milk (would be richer with half and half or whole milk).
Cooked the cauliflower on high for 5 minutes with a quick release.
During that I saut√©ed the garlic.
Then after the cauliflower is done, dump it all into a blender and blend.</description>
