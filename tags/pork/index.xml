      <description>Cooking pork chops and finished in bacon grease in cast iron Used the Joule to cook fresh bone-on pork chops at at 140 degrees for 1 hour.
While that was cooking I cooked 8 strips of bacon in a cast iron skillet.
After the pork chops were done I browned the pork chops in the left over bacon grease. Why not?</description>

      <description>Ribs 3-2-1 Method Came out tender, but not fall off the bone.
Basically, followed various sites and books; there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot to the basic process.
Removed the membrane and used a rib rub.
Place ribs in smoker at 225 degrees F for three hours.
Wrap ribs tightly in foil and smoke for 2 hours.
Take foil off and return to smoker bone side down for 1 hour.
Apply sauce to ribs during the last 30 minutes of cooking time.</description>
