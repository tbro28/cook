      <description>Ingredients Frozen ground beef
1 cup of water
Instructions 25 minutes on high with a quick release.
Notes Also added onions, garlic, and taco seasoning. Add the onions, garlic, and seasoning after the initial pressure cooking (or they turn to liquid and burn to the bottom; see pic 2!).
Want to alter this to 1&amp;frasl;2 cup of water, because the ground beef released a lot of liquid that took a while to cook down.</description>

      <description>Frozen Ground Beef Came out tender.
1 cup of water and set it to 25 minutes with a quick release.
Also added onions, garlic, and taco seasoning.
Would alter this to 1&amp;frasl;2 cup of water, plus add the onions, garlic, and seasoning after the initial pressure cooking.</description>
