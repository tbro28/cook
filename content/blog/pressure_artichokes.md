#### Ingredients
2 artichokes
1 cup of water  
1 lemon  

#### Instructions
1. Cut off the stem and top of the artichoke(s).
* Rub a slice of lemon on the outside of the artichoke; supposedly it prevents browning.

* Add everything into the Instant Pot.  
* Put on the lid and set to high pressure for 10 minutes.  
* Do a quick release when the timer goes off.

#### Notes
* The leaves were perfect, but the heart was a little firm. Not bad, but I think I'll try adding a minute in the future.
