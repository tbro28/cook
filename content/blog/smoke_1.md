## Ribs 3-2-1 Method

Came out tender, but not fall off the bone.
Basically, followed various sites and books; there isn't a lot to the basic process.
Removed the membrane and used a rib rub.
Place ribs in smoker at 225 degrees F for three hours.
Wrap ribs tightly in foil and smoke for 2 hours.
Take foil off and return to smoker bone side down for 1 hour.
Apply sauce to ribs during the last 30 minutes of cooking time.
