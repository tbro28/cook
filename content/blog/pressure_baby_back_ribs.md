#### Ingredients

#### Instructions
1. Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs if present and apply the dry rub seasoning to both sides.  
* Cut the ribs into chunks of 4-6 ribs, so that they fit in the instant pot.

* Set the ribs in the instant pot.
* Add the cup of broth and liquid smoke.  
* Put on the lid and set to high pressure for 25 minutes.  
* After the 25 minutes do a natural release for 5 minutes before releasing the remaining pressure.  
* Set an oven to 450 degrees.  
* Place the ribs on a baking sheet and baste them with BBQ sauce.

* Put them in the oven for 15 minutes.  

#### Notes
25 minutes will make them fall a part, so you might want less.  You can see how much the meat pulled away from the end of the bones.
