## Ribs 3-2-1 Method

#### Ingredients
Ribs.  
Rib rub (I'm lazy and use pre-made ones).  

#### Instructions
Removed the membrane and used a rib rub.  
Place ribs in smoker at 225 degrees F for three hours.  
Wrap ribs tightly in foil and smoke for 2 hours.  
Take foil off and return to smoker bone side down for 1 hour.  
Apply sauce to ribs during the last 30 minutes of cooking time.  

#### Notes
Came out tender, but not fall off the bone.
Basically, followed various sites and books; there isn't a lot to the basic process.
