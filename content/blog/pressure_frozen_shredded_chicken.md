#### Ingredients
Chicken  
1 cup of water  
A packet of Trade Joes chicken stock  

#### Instructions
25 minutes on high with a quick release.  

#### Notes
All chicken was over 200 degrees and very easy to shred.  
If the chicken breasts are thick I add an extra 5 minutes. I buy the 10 lb bags of Foster Farms frozen chicken at Costco and do three at a time. Some of the pieces are huge and 25 minutes wasn't cutting it and 35 was too long.
