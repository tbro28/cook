1. Turn the instant pot onto saut√© with some vegetable oil.  
* Cut up the onion, cabbage, and sausage. I normally cut the cabbage into eigths.

#### Notes
You can buy two different sausages for more flavors.  
I used 1/2 cup of broth the first time and with the salt from the sausage it was overly salty in my opinion.  
I have tried using 1/4 cup of water too, but it couldn't come to pressure.  
I have used 2 12 oz packages of sausage, but that makes a lot.
