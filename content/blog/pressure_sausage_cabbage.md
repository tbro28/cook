#### Instructions
Turn the instant pot onto saut√© with some vegetable oil.  
Cut up the onion, cabbage, and sausage.  
Put the onion, garlic, and sausage into the pot.  
Saute for a couple of minutes, just to cook and brown it.

#### Notes
I used broth the first time and with the salt from the sausage it was overly salty in my opinion.
