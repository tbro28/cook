## Chainmail Scrubber

This thing works great on quickly cleaning stainless steel and cast iron. Careful with how much pressure you put or you'll scratch and/or remove the seasoning on the pan.    
In some of my sous vide pictures you can see that I also use it to weigh down food that wants to float to the top.
