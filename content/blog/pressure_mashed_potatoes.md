#### Ingredients
Russet potatoes  
1 cup of water  
Half a stick of butter (4 tbsp)  
Garlic powder  
1/2 cup of sour cream  
1/2 cup of warm milk (I use 2%, because that's what I have)  

#### Instructions
1. Cut the potatoes into pieces.  I normally cut lengthwise and then into quarter inch pieces down the width of the potato. I also am too lazy to peel them, so I leave the skin on. Isn't it healthier too?  
* Put the potatoes and water into the Instant Pot and cook on high for 10 minutes with a quick release.  
* Drain the water and put the potatoes back in the pot.  
* Add the butter and lighty mash until the butter is gone.  
* Sprinkle a layer of garlic powder on top of the potatoes.  
* Add the sour cream and roughly half of the milk.  
* Start mashing, if the potatoes are too thick then add more of the milk.  
Potatoes are known for being very different, so some batches will require more or less milk in order to get the same result.  

#### Notes
My favorite potatoes.  
Tons of variations can be done, like adding in cheese, etc.
