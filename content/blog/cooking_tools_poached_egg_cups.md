Bought these during one of Amazon's Cyber Monday deals.  They work good for me and can be used in an Instant Pot too.  However, I stopped using the Instant Pot with them, because it is hard to dial in the doneness and it is way overkill to use a pressure cooking poached eggs anyways.  Now, with the whole egg still in the shell pressure cookers are great for soft and hard boiled eggs.
