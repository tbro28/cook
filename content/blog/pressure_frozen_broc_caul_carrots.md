#### Ingredients
Bag of frozen broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots  
1 cup of water  

#### Instructions
1. Add the veggies to the pot (put as much as desired).  
* Cook it for 1 minute on low pressure with a quick release.  

I use this bag from Costco most of the time

#### Notes
Anything more than 1 minute makes them mushy (and unappealing in my opinion).
