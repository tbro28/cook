#### Ingredients
Bag of frozen broccoli  
1 cup of water  

#### Instructions
2 minutes on low pressure with a quick release.  
OR  
Zero minutes on high with a quick release.  

#### Notes
Came out tender, but not mushy.  
Using low pressure gives you more control and you can dial in the doneness of vegetables much better.  
I've turned a lot of vegetables to mush on the high pressure setting.
