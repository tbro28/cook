#### Ingredients
Head of green cabbage.  
1 cup of water.  

#### Instructions
Cut the cabbage into eighths.  
Cook it for 7 minutes on high with a quick release.  

#### Notes
Came out tender, but not mushy. For me anything over 7 minutes starts to get too mushy for my tastes. I've seen other recipes that say 10 minutes, but...you can always cook it longer if desired if 7 isn't enough.
