#### Ingredients
1 lb ground beef  
3 c. beef broth  
1/2 c. minced onion  
3 c. egg noodles, uncooked  
10.5 oz can cream of mushroom soup  
1 garlic clove, minced  
1/4 tsp pepper  
1 Tbsp Flour  
1 c. sour cream  
  
Optional:  
1 tsp salt  

#### Instructions
1. Set the instant pot to sauté with some oil in it.  
* Sauté the hamburger, garlic, and onion until the meat is browned.  
* Add the flour.  
* Add the noodles.
* Then the broth, soup, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.  
* Put on the lid and set to high pressure for 8 minutes.  
* After the 8 minutes let it natural release for another 5 minutes before releasing the pressure.  
* Add the sour cream and mix it all together.

#### Notes
* I used frozen hamburger, so I had to cook that first on high for 25 minutes with 1 cup of water. Then started at step two with sautéing the vegetables and adding the meat back in with those.  
* I won't be adding the salt next time either, because it came out salty to me. From the broth and maybe the mushroom soup too. Definitely overkill on the saltiness.  
* CAREFULL with cooking too long and turning the noodles to mush.
