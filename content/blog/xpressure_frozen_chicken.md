## Frozen Chicken

#### Ingredients
Chicken
1 cup of water
A packet of Trade Joes chicken stock

#### Instructions
25 minutes on high with a quick release.  

#### Notes
Came out tender, but not mushy.


I was supposed to do a natural release, but I did a quick release and it didn't seem to affect the texture.  
It came out tender, but I still plan to play with the times a bit in the future. Primarily because recommendations online that I read were all over the place.
