## Sous Vide Frozen Cod

#### Ingredients
Frozen cod fillets roughly 1.5 inched thick.   

#### Instructions
Used the Joule to cook them for at 122 degrees for 1.5 hours.  

#### Notes
I actually want to try it at 131 degrees next time to make it even more flaky.  
I may just be used to over cooked fish though :)
