#### Ingredients
Frozen ground beef  
1 cup of water  

#### Instructions
25 minutes on high with a quick release.  

#### Notes
Also added onions, garlic, and taco seasoning.
Add the onions, garlic, and seasoning after the initial pressure cooking (or they turn to liquid and burn to the bottom; see pic 2!).    
Want to alter this to 1/2 cup of water, because the ground beef released a lot of liquid that took a while to cook down.
