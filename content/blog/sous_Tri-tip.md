## Tri-tip at 130 for 6 hours



#### Ingredients
Tri-tip.  

#### Instructions
Cook it at 130 degree for 6 hours.    
Then grill them in a cast iron skillet with butter to add a sear to them.  
Seared in a cast iron skillet with oil and butter.  
15 seconds per flip for two minutes.  

#### Notes
Came out extremely tender.  
7 hours might make it a little better in the middle.  
Cutting a 3.5 - 4 lb tri-tip in half also could help.
