Finished them by basting them with BBQ sauce and putting them in a 300 degree oven for 40 minutes. Brush the ribs with sauce after 20 minutes. Reapply more sauce after 10 additional minutes. Wait for a bark to form!

#### Notes
One more win for sous vide.  
This cook was the one that convinced me to buy ping pong balls to stop the water from evaporating.
