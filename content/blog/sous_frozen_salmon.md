## Sous Vide Frozen Salmon Fillets

#### Ingredients
Frozen salmon fillets roughly 1.5 inched thick.
Olive oil.  
1 tbsp of lemon juice.  
Salt.  
Pepper.  

#### Instructions
1. Put everything into the bag and seal it up.   
* Used the Joule to cook them for at 131 degrees for 1.5 hours.  
* Take them out and sear them skin side down in a cast iron pan. I started eating the skin this way, otherwise skip this step for those that don't like the skin.  I personally had never eaten the skin before using the method.  

#### Notes
I'm a huge fan of the mustard dill sauce that Ikea carries. It tastes great with salmon. Getting food at a huge furniture store always feels a little weird!
