1 cup of water and set it to 10 minutes.  
Also added a packet of Trade Joes chicken stock.  
I was supposed to do a natural release, but I did a quick release and it didn't seem to affect the texture.  
It came out tender, but I still plan to play with the times a bit in the future. Primarily because recommendations online that I read were all over the place.
