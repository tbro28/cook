#### Ingredients
1 - 2 lbs of frozen meat balls  
24 oz jar of sauce
Italian seasoning
1 box of penne pasta

#### Instructions
1. Dump the meatballs into the Instant Pot.  Level them out to try to create one layer.  
* Put the noodles on top of the meatballs.
* Empty the jar of sauce onto the noodles.
* Fill the jar full of water and add that down the side of the container, so that the sauce isn't washed to the bottom.
* Fill the jar roughly 1/4th of the way again and add that too.
* Sprinkle the Italian seasoning onto the sauce.

* Put on the lid and set to high pressure for 7 minutes or half the time that it says to cook the box of noodles.  
* Quick release when the timer goes off and it should be done.

#### Notes
* The frozen meatballs will increase the time it takes to come to pressure. I'd guess in total it is closer to 30 minutes to cook.
* You can add an onion or other vegetables too; 7 minutes on high will create really mushy vegetables in a lot of cases though.
