#### Ingredients
Package of corned beef (with the seasoning packet)  
4 cups of water  
Onion  
Potatoes  
Carrots  
Cabbage  

#### Instructions
1. Rinse the meat to get rid of as much salt as possible
* Cut the meat into 4 pieces (easier to fit into my Instant Pot and it cooks faster).     
* Place it in the pot trying to make one level layer.   
* Pour in the water and sprinkle the seasoning packet on the meat.  
* Cut the onion into fourths and add it in too.

* Set the Instant Pot to 70 minutes on high.  
* When the timer goes off let it natural release for 15 minutes before releasing the pressure.  
* Take the meat out.  
* Cut up the potatoes into 1/2 inch chucks. You can them to cook completely in the same time as the other vegetables.  
* Cut the cabbage into 1/8ths.  
* Put all of the vegetables into the Instant Pot. Since I have two pots I normally have this ready in the second pot and simply pour two cups of the liquid from the meat into the second pot.  
* Cook the vegetables for 7 minutes on high with a quick release.  

#### Notes
I used more than 4 cups of water with a 4+ lb corned beef and when I released the pressure liquid came shooting out of the top.  I likely won't ever use more that 4 cups again. Some recipes say to make sure that the beef is covered in water like you would do in a pot, but in a pressure cooker I'm not sure that is a factor.
