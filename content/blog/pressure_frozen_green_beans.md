#### Ingredients
Bag of frozen green beans  
1 cup of water  

#### Instructions
Put as much as desired into the pot.  
Cook it for 1 minutes on low pressure with a quick release.  

#### Notes
Comes out tender.  
I often mix in other vegetables and cook them for 2 minutes; it just makes them softer obviously :)
