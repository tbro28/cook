#### Ingredients
1 to 1.5 lbs of boneless chicken breasts  
1 cup of chicken stock  
1 packet ranch seasoning  
8 oz cream cheese  
3 cups water  
1 cup cheddar cheese  
4 oz of shredded cheese  
1/4 cup of hot wing sauce (some version of Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce)  
  
Optional (although it shouldn't be!):  
4 slices of cooked and crumbled bacon  

#### Instructions
1. Put in chicken and chicken stock water.  
* Cook on high for 15 minutes with a quick release (25 minutes if the chicken is frozen).  
* While the chicken is cooking in sauce pan on low melt the cream cheese (or microwave to soften if desired), ranch seasoning, and hot sauce.  
* Pull the chicken out and shred it when it is done.  
* Mix the chicken with the mixture.  
* Empty the Instant Pot bowl, add two cups of water and the noodles.
* Put the mixture on top of the noodles, but do not mix (it will increase scorching the bottom).  
* Cook on high for 4 minutes with a quick release  
* Add the chicken back with the cheese (and bacon).  
* Stir in the shredded cheese until everything is combined.

#### Notes
I have had issues with scorching the bottom a little. A solution would be just to not add the mixture until after the noddles are cooked.
