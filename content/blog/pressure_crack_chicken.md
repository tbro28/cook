#### Ingredients
2 pounds boneless chicken breast  
1 packet ranch seasoning  
8 oz cream cheese  
1/2 cup water  
1 cup cheddar cheese  

Optional (although it shouldn't be!):  
6-8 slices cooked bacon  

#### Instructions
1. Put in chicken, water, seasoning, and cream cheese.  
* Cook on high for 15 minutes with a quick release.  
* Leave the instant pot on low.  
* Pull the chicken out and shred it.  
* Add the chicken back with the cheese (and bacon).  
* Then mix until it thickens.  

#### Notes
Easy and awesome tasting.  
I've used frozen chicken for this too.  In that case I did 15 minutes with just chicken and water, then opened it up and added the ranch and cream cheese.
