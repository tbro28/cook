Seasoning   
1 c. BBQ Sauce  
1/2 c. water  
Optional:  
Salt (depending on how salty your seasoning is)

#### Instructions
1. Set the ribs in the instant pot.
* Add the 1/2 cup of water.  
* Cover the ribs with seasoning.  I did half with one of these and half with the other.

* Add 1/2 cup of the BBQ sauce on top.  The other half is for a sauce later.  I simply used Sweet Baby Rays (from Costco).

* Put on the lid and set to high pressure for 45 minutes.

#### Make the sauce
1. Take the ribs out.
* Measure out 1/2 cup of the liquid in the instant pot.  
* Mix that with the remaining 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce and use it with the ribs of course!
