      <description>Ingredients Head of green cabbage.
1 cup of water.
Instructions Cut the cabbage into eighths.
Cook it for 7 minutes on high with a quick release.
Notes Came out tender, but not mushy. For me anything over 7 minutes starts to get too mushy for my tastes. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen other recipes that say 10 minutes, but&amp;hellip;you can always cook it longer if desired if 7 isn&amp;rsquo;t enough.</description>

      <title>Frozen Ground Beef</title>
      <link>https://tbro28.github.io/cook/blog/2015/10/10/pressure_frozen_ground_beef/</link>

      <guid>https://tbro28.github.io/cook/blog/2015/10/10/pressure_frozen_ground_beef/</guid>
      <description>Ingredients Frozen ground beef
1 cup of water
Instructions 25 minutes on high with a quick release.
Notes Frozon turkey also works great at 25 minutes.
The first time I also added onions, garlic, and taco seasoning at the beginning. Bad mistake!
Add the onions, garlic, and seasoning after the initial pressure cooking (or they turn to liquid and burn to the bottom; see pic 2!).
Want to alter this to 1&amp;frasl;2 cup of water, because the ground beef released a lot of liquid that took a while to cook down.</description>

      <description>Ingredients Chicken
1 cup of water
A packet of Trade Joes chicken stock
Instructions 25 minutes on high with a quick release.
Notes All chicken was over 200 degrees and very easy to shred.
If the chicken breasts are thick I add an extra 5 minutes. I buy the 10 lb bags of Foster Farms frozen chicken at Costco and do three at a time. Some of the pieces are huge and 25 minutes wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it and 35 was too long.</description>
