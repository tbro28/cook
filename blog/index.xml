      <description> Chicken at 158 for 2 hours Came out extremely tender and juicy. Used for lunches throughout the week. Therefore, I didn&amp;rsquo;t seare it; I took it out and submerged in an ice bath following by the fridge. Might try 149 degrees that a lot of sites suggest for even more tender results.

      <description>Ribs 3-2-1 Method Came out tender, but not fall off the bone. Basically, followed various sites and books; there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot to the basic process. Removed the membrane and used a rib rub. Place ribs in smoker at 225 degrees F for three hours. Wrap ribs tightly in foil and smoke for 2 hours. Take foil off and return to smoker bone side down for 1 hour. Apply sauce to ribs during the last 30 minutes of cooking time.</description>

      <description> Ping Pong Balls To Retain Heat Went to the Dollar Tree near my house and bought 8 packages of 6 balls. These trap the water from evaporating on long cooks. It has so far been extremely effective.

      <description> Morton&amp;rsquo;s Tri-tip at 130 for 6 hours Came out extremely tender. 7 hours might make it a little better in the middle. Cutting a 3.5 - 4 lb tri-tip in half also could help.
Seared in a cast iron skillet with oil and butter. 15 seconds per flip for two minutes.
